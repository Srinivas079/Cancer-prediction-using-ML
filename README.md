Dataset Preparation: Loaded a breast cancer dataset with columns such as id, diagnosis, radius_mean, texture_mean, and various other features. The target variable diagnosis was converted to a categorical type and label encoded.
Data Visualization: Conducted exploratory data analysis including correlation heatmaps and box plots to visualize feature distributions and correlations with the diagnosis variable.
Model Training: Implemented and tuned machine learning models including Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization. Performed data resampling using SMOTE to address class imbalance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report, achieving high accuracy scores across different models.
Model Deployment: Saved trained models using pickle and demonstrated loading and prediction on new data, ensuring reproducibility and easy integration into a web application.
